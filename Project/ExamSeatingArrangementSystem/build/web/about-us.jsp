It is the duty of the exam invigilator to watch the examination candidates to prevent cheating during the examination. They are required to ensure that all the exams are carried out according to the rules set out by the exam board which allows each candidate to sit for the examination under equal conditions as other candidates throughout the country.

		Exam Invigilators are appointed to a position of trust and they should possess the quality of integrity and vigilance to conduct the examinations in exact accordance with the examination boardâ€™s instructions.

		The purpose of exam invigilation is to ensure that all candidates are under active surveillance for every moment of the duration of the examination. Invigilators should also try to provide a suitably pleasant and supportive atmosphere for candidates. However, they must also ensure and prevent any kind of communication between candidates (by copying, whispering or any kind of signal, exchange of paper or objects) and any kind of access to books, papers or electronic media of any kind (unless specifically authorized) for the exam duration.
